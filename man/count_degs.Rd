\title{Count Differentially Expressed Genes (DEGs)}
\usage{
count_degs(diff_results, fc_thresholds = c(1, 1.5, 2), p_threshold = 0.05)
}
\arguments{
\item{diff_results}{A data frame containing differential expression results.
Must include columns for log fold change and adjusted p-value.}

\item{fc_thresholds}{A numeric vector of fold change thresholds.
Default is c(1, 1.5, 2).}

\item{p_threshold}{Numeric. The p-value threshold for significance.
Default is 0.05.}
}
\value{
This function doesn't return a value, but prints the counts of
up-regulated and down-regulated genes for each threshold.
}
\description{
This function counts the number of up-regulated and down-regulated genes
based on given fold change thresholds and p-value threshold.

\examples{
# Assuming diff_results is your differential expression results data frame
# count_degs(diff_results)
# count_degs(diff_results, fc_thresholds = c(1, 2, 3), p_threshold = 0.01)

\title{Process Expression Data}
\usage{
process_expression_data(data, platform)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame or matrix of expression data, with probe IDs as row names
and samples as columns.}

\item{platform}{A character string specifying the microarray platform (e.g., "gpl570").}
}
\value{
A data frame of processed expression data, with gene symbols as row names
and samples as columns. For each gene, only the probe with the highest average
expression is retained.
}
\description{
This function processes expression data by mapping probe IDs to gene symbols
and selecting the probe with the highest average expression for each gene.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Assuming you have your expression data in a data frame called 'expr_data'
processed_data <- process_expression_data(expr_data, platform = "gpl570")
}
